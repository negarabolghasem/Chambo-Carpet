# Chambo-Carpet
- This project analyzes data from a company that sells carpets. One of the most important steps in its process is sending carpet samples to potential customers, which incurs a high cost for the company if the sent sample is not ordered by the customer. The company needs to know if there is any model or algorithm that can predict the suitable type of sample to send to customers.
- In this regard, I tried classification models for different types of data abput sales and sampling.
